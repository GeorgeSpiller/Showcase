This task involved both mapping coral reefs extensively, and allowed me to improve my scuba diving skills alongside helping save some of the world's most beautiful coral reefs. While out there I traind to qualify for my PADI advanced diver qualification, allowing me to descend to a depth of up to 30m inorder to help survey and catalogue some of the deeper reefs around the area.",
    text_p2: "Our main duties as a team were to identify reef fish and invertebrates for a marine research and conservation programme in association with L'Institut Halieutique et des Sciences Marine. This conservation programme is a collation and study of species through a series of dives, providing communities, stakeholders and government bodies with information to formulate management plans for the protection of the Malagasy marine ecosystem. ",
    text_p3: "During my stay over in Madagascar, I also helped with land-based ecological surveys, cataloging and tracking local lemurs and chameleons. Alongside this research, our team assisted the local residents by finishing a previous year’s project to build them a toilet and shower block. This would allow the village’s residents both access to clean running water and basic hygiene.",
